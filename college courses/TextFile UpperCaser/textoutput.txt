ONCE UPON A MIDNIGHT DREARY, FINGERS CRAMPED AND VISION BLEARY, 
SYSTEM MANUALS PILED HIGH AND WASTED PAPER ON THE FLOOR, 
LONGING FOR THE WARMTH OF BED SHEETS, STILL I SAT THERE DOING SPREADSHEETS. 
HAVING REACHED THE BOTTOM LINE I TOOK A FLOPPY FROM THE DRAWER 
I THEN INVOKED THE SAVE COMMAND AND WAITED FOR THE DISK TO STORE, 
ONLY THIS AND NOTHING MORE.

DEEP INTO THE MONITOR PEERING, LONG I SAT THERE WOND'RING, FEARING. 
DOUBTING, WHILE THE DISK KEPT CHURNING, TURNING YET TO CHURN SOME MORE. 
BUT THE SILENCE WAS UNBROKEN, AND THE STILLNESS GAVE NO TOKEN. 
"SAVE!" I SAID, "YOU CURSED MOTHER! SAVE MY DATA FROM BEFORE!" 
ONE THING DID THE PHOSPHORS ANSWER, ONLY THIS AND NOTHING MORE, 
JUST, "ABORT, RETRY, IGNORE?"
