Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary, 
System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor, 
Longing for the warmth of bed sheets, still I sat there doing spreadsheets. 
Having reached the bottom line I took a floppy from the drawer 
I then invoked the SAVE command and waited for the disk to store, 
Only this and nothing more.

Deep into the monitor peering, long I sat there wond'ring, fearing. 
Doubting, while the disk kept churning, turning yet to churn some more. 
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token. 
"Save!" I said, "You cursed mother! Save my data from before!" 
One thing did the phosphors answer, only this and nothing more, 
Just, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"
